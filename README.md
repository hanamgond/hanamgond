Hi, I’m Hanam — a Senior Product Manager focused on building AI-first B2B and B2C SaaS platforms.

I work at the intersection of **product strategy, system design, and execution**, with a strong track record of taking products from **0 → 1** and scaling them in real-world, high-ambiguity environments.

### What I specialize in
- 0→1 product development and early-stage scaling
- Multi-tenant SaaS & platform design
- AI-powered workflows and intelligent automation
- B2C and D2C product platforms
- Translating complex operational problems into scalable systems

### How I think about products
- Start with real user and business pain points
- Design systems that scale before features that impress
- Use AI where it meaningfully improves outcomes
- Measure success through adoption, reliability, and operational efficiency

### What this GitHub showcases
- Real-world product builds
- Platform and system architecture decisions
- Product trade-offs, metrics, and risk considerations
- Documentation that reflects product thinking beyond decks and documents

Feel free to explore the pinned repositories to see how I approach product problems end-to-end.
